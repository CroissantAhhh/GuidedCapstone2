    "Mercari is an online shopping website where sellers are able to freely set their own prices on products. Unlike for example Amazon, sellers on Mercari are all individuals rather than companies, who already know what prices to place on their products. Therefore, determining prices is more tricky for these individual sellers on Mercari. Not only do they need to take into account the branding and the quality of their item, but also its current condition. Our goal is to build regression models that will be able to predict the price of a new item listing, given the item's other characteristics. This will allow sellers to set more accurate prices, which will improve the market dynamics of the shopping platform."
